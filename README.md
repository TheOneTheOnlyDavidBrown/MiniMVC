MiniMVC
=======

Simple MVC I created for educational purposes and works much like CodeIgniter. Currently uses Flourish (http://flourishlib.com/) for some of the libraries.

Implements my [PHP Database Driver](https://github.com/davidbrownucf/phpdatabasedriver)

It is made to be very flexible in terms of adding new libraries/extensions.

Controllers can be restful to cater to AJAX calls

Built in JavaScript hierarchy to allow function to inherit from others.
